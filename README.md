This webapp provides a versatile user-interface to the PCE/PCE.js suite of virtual machine emulators. This webapp builds upon the emulation core to provide you with the ability to access documentation and disk images that reside on the web or locally on your own computer. This wrapper has been written generally enough that it may be modified for use by any emulator that has been cross-compiled into JavaScript using the Emscripten toolchain. The current release provides a functional, web-based simulation of a vintage Macintosh computer alongside a navigator interface for accessing hyper-linked resources on the web.
