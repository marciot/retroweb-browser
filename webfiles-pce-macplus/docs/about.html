			<h2>What is this?</h2>
			<p>
				This webapp allows you to interact with a virtual simulation of a Mac
				computer from the mid nineteen eighties; specifically, a Mac Plus as
				emulated by "PCE/macplus" from the PCE collection.
			</p>
			<p>
				More generally, this webapp is a reusable user-interface written in JavaScript
				that wraps around the emulation core and provides you with the ability to access
				documentation and disk images that reside on the web or locally on your own
				computer. This wrapper has been written generally enough that it may be modified
				to use any emulator that has been cross-compiled into JavaScript using the
				Emscripten toolchain.
			</p>

			<p>
				This webapp contains the use of trademarks from Apple Computer. It is

			<h2>Credits:</h2>
			
			<p>
				Although I put together this webapp, the heavy lifting was done by others. The
				emulator is a modified version of PCE, written in C by Hampa Hug and modified by
				James Friend to cross-compile into JavaScript through Emscripten.
			</p>
			<p>
				I have added the JavaScript, HTML and CSS code that drives the user interface and
				navigator, as well as made some modifications to PCE to expose to JavaScript the
				ability to insert disks after boot.
