			<h2>Advanced Actions</h2>
			<p>
				The advanced actions allow you to interact with the
				emulator directly. These actions are intended for more
				technically savvy users.
			</p>
			<h3>Restart</h3>
			<p>
				This action restarts the emulated computer. It is
				useful if the computer has crashed. Refreshing the
				webpage also restarts the computer, but you will
				have to wait for the disk images to download from
				the server again and changes to the local disks
				will be lost. The Restart action is much faster
				and will preserve your changes.
			</p>
			<h3>Load ROM</h3>
			<p>
				This action allows you to load in a ROM image for
				use by the emulator. This is required to start
				the emulated computer. This emulator supports the
				ROM images that are distributed in the PCE download
				page.
			</p>
			<h3>Load floppy</h3>
			<p>
				This action can be used to load floppy images that
				are stored on local computer into the emulator.
			</p>
			<p>
				Not all disk images will be compatible with this
				emulator and vintage software is often distributed
				in files that must be unpacked and copied into disk
				images using other tools.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you wish to obtaining software on your own, the
				following websites will get you started:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://macintoshgarden.org" target="_new">The Macintosh Garden</a></li>
				<li><a href="http://www.emaculation.com/doku.php/system_6_hell" target="_new">System 6 Hell</a></li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				At the present, quite a few of these disk images will fail
				to load silently (i.e. nothing will happen after you select
				them with the "Local floppy..." action).
			</p>
			<h3>Enter RetroWeb URL</h3>
			</p>
				This action allows you to enter an URL for a RetroWeb JSON
				file. This is an index formatted specifically for this
				webapp that allows you to reach more content.
			</p>
			<p>
				This webapp makes use of <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> and
				<a href="http://enable-cors.org/">CORS</a> technologies to allow for the
				dynamic hyper-linking of resources, thus providing the "web" part of
				RetroWeb.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you own a website, you can use this functionality to host
				your own resources for this emulator. By publishing an index file
				and implementing CORS, others will be allowed to link to your
				content from their own instances of this webapp.
			</p>
			<h3>Go back</h3>
			<p>
				This action takes you back to the starting menu.
