= About the Apple //e =

Hello, this is my attempt at getting the JSMESS emulators integrated with my RetroWeb Browser
interface!

Here you'll find two historic Apple II programs, the subLOGIC Flight Simulator and VisiCalc for your
experimentation.

== Historic Software ==

{
	"icons" : [
		["subLOGIC Flight Simulator",  "folder-dot"],
		["VisiCalc Spreadsheet",       "folder-dot", "VisiCalc"]
	]
}

== About the Emulator ==

{
	"icons" : [
		["JSMESS Web Page",  "hyperlink", "http://jsmess.textfiles.com"],
		["MESS Web Page",    "hyperlink", "http://www.mess.org"]
	],
	"class" : "float-right"
}

This emulator is from the JSMESS project, a JavaScript port of the MESS personal computer emulators collection.
