= Battle Chess =

Battle Chess was the first game independently developed and released by Interplay in 1988[1] and the start of a franchise that continues to this day. Featuring chess pieces that came to life in battle, it received critical acclaim for its clever graphics and animation.

After its debut on the Commodore Amiga in 1988, Battle Chess was ported to the many personal computers of the time. Most versions included modem play, which in the era before the Internet, allowed people to play head-to-head with one another.
