= Commodore 64 =

{
"icons" : [
		["subLOGIC Flight Simulator", "folder-dot"],
		["Flappy Bird", "folder-dot"]
	]
}

The Commodore 64 emulator is sluggish. The Flight Simulator and the Flappy bird demos run reasonably well.

== Christmas Demo ==

{
"icons" : [
		["Christmas Demo", "boot-floppy", "/disks/c64-christmas-demo.d64"]
	]
}

The Christmas Demo looks very cool, but is rather difficult to get running because the emulated computer runs so slowly. If you wish to try running it, you will need some patience:

* Click the "Christmas Demo" icon
* At the READY prompt, type "load@christmas album@,8,1" very slowly. Wait for the system to echo each character before going to the next, as characters are often missed and you cannot go back if you make a mistake.
* Wait a '''really''' long time for it to load.
