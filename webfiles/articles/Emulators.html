= What is an Emulator? =

In computer science, an emulator is a piece of software that allows a modern computer to mimic the functionality of another, possibly earlier, computer system.

Emulators allow operating systems and programs from the original computer to run without the original hardware and as such are an important tool in historical preservation.

The <cite>RetroWeb Vintage Computer Museum</cite> makes use of several emulators to allow you to experience computers and software from the early 80s.

== PCE (PC Emulator) ==

[[PCE (PC Emulator)]] is a emulator for four different computer systems written in ANSI C by Hampa Hug.

Computers emulated:

* [[Apple Macintosh]] (128K, 512K, 512ke, Plus, SE &amp; Classic)
* [[IBM PC]] (Models 5150 and 5160)
* Various [[Atari ST]] and Mega ST Models
* [[Regnecentralen RC759 Piccoline]]

The Macintosh emulator from PCE was cross-compiled into Javascript by [[James Friend]] using the [[Emscripten]] toolkit; this work was the direct inspiration for the <cite>RetroWeb Vintage Computer Museum</cite>.

== Scriped Amiga Emulator ==

The Amiga emulator used here is a slightly modified version of Rupert Hausberger's [[SAE (Scriped Amiga Emulator)]].
It was written natively in JavaScript and is heavily based on [[WinUAE]]

== MAME ==

The [[MAME]] project is a collection of emulators originally written by Nicola Salmoria and now maintained by several contributors. [[MAME]] is written in C++, but was cross-compiled into JavaScript by the JSMESS team. The following emulators are used specifically in this museum:

* [[Apple //]]
* [[Commodore 64]]
* [[Tandy TRS-80 Model I]]
