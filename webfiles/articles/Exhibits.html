= Museum Exhibits =

These exhibits are the aggregation of materials gathered from public sources. I have included hyperlinks and references throughout. There is much here to explore, learn and enjoy!

== Learn about machine emulation ==

{ "icons" : [
		["Learn about Emulation",    "doc", "Emulators.html"]
	]
}

The <cite>RetroWeb Vintage Computer Museum</cite> makes use of several emulators to allow you to experience computers and software from the 70s and 80s.

Click the icon to learn about emulators and the people who made this museum possible.

== The History of the GUI ==

[[image-float-right:/artwork/1968-Demo-Thumbnail.jpg]]

Learn how the graphical user interface evolved, beginning with the demonstration of a mouse-based interface in 1968 to the release of Microsoft Windows in 1985.

Experience several of these early GUIs for yourself, running on their original (emulated) computers, in the [[History of the GUI]] exhibit.

== Marcio's Mac ==

[[image-float-left:/artwork/marcio's-mac.png]]

The RetroWeb Vintage Computer Museum began as a very personal tribute to the Macintosh's thirtieth birthday.

In [[Marcio's Mac]], I share my story of growing up with the Macintosh. Come interact with several Macintosh programs I wrote through the years, all inside a recreation of my childhood Macintosh.
