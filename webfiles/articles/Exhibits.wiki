= Museum Exhibits =

These exhibits are the aggregation of materials gathered from public sources. I have included hyperlinks and references throughout. There is much here to explore, learn and enjoy!

== The History of the GUI ==

[[image-float-right:/artwork/1968-Demo-Thumbnail.jpg]]

Learn how the graphical user interface evolved, beginning with the demonstration of a mouse-based interface in 1968 to the release of Microsoft Windows in 1985.

Experience several of these early GUIs for yourself, running on their original (emulated) computers, in this [[fully interactive web history|History of the GUI]].

== Marcio's Mac ==

[[image-float-left:/artwork/marcio's-mac.png]]

The RetroWeb Vintage Computer Museum began as a very personal tribute to the Macintosh's thirtieth birthday.

In the [[inaugural web exhibit|Marcio's Mac]], I share my story of growing up with the Macintosh. Come interact with several Macintosh programs I wrote through the years, all inside a recreation of my childhood Macintosh.

== Firsts in Software ==

* The first chatbot.

Choose a computer from the "Change computer type..." pull-down menu at the top of this window, then follow the green dot to find a boot disk to start the in-browser emulation.
