I have been fascinated by the Mandelbrot set for as long as I can remember&mdash;the endless coastline, the thicket of wispy branches, the army of seahorses standing to attention, the occasional child-Mandelbrot hanging on to its parent by a tendril.

<hr>

One of my earliest experiences with the Mandelbrot set was through a program called Super MANDELZOOM by Robert P. Munafo[1].

It was fascinating, a portal into a world apart, but watching as the grainy images were slowly beamed across from that world to ours was anti-climatic. I took screenshots from that program and made a flipbook-style animation to demonstrate what it would be like to <em>free-fall</em> into the depths of the fractal rabbit hole.

<hr>

So <em>what exactly</em> is the Mandelbrot set? It's just an equation. An equation that when written out in computer code is actually quite uncomplicated; that same computer code then takes us to a world that is far too deep and complex for the thing from whence it came.

<hr>

I don't remember when I learned enough of the math behind the Mandelbrot set to write my own program&mdash;even after I was formally introduced to imaginary numbers in school, I still saw them as merely a ticket to the Mandelbrot universe and of little more use to me than that&mdash;but as something that had captured my imagination for so long, it was an accomplishment to write my own Mandelbrot program, even if I did not exactly understand how it worked.

I can't shake the feeling that the equation that purportedly gives us the Mandelbrot set is a red-herring; it can create the landscape beyond it no more than a door can create what we experience after we step beyond its threshold.

And so, I wonder, where lies this beyond? If not in the equation itself, then where do the frothy whorls and eddies of the Mandelbrot landscape exist?

I do not know the answer to that question&mdash;I probably never will. But the Mandelbrot set became a clich&eacute; for me; it became a visual "Hello World!", a small program I could write in any programming language, for any computer I encountered since, whenever I had a moment to step beyond that threshold and into another realm.
