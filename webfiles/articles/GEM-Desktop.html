GEM/1 was released for the [[IBM PC]] by Digital Research Inc. (DRI) in 1985.

GEM is not a complete operating system, but rather a graphical interface that runs on top of DOS.

The interface used in GEM was so similar to the [[Macintosh]] that Apple successfully sued for copyright infringement[1]. As a result of this lawsuit, DRI removed visual effects and overlapping windows from subsequent releases.

GEM was ported to the 68000 microprocessor by Atari and was included with [[Atari's ST line]] of computers in 1985.

The Javascript port is based on work done by James Friend[3]
