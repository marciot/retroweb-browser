= GEM Desktop =

GEM/1 was released for the IBM PC by Digital Research Inc. (DRI) in 1985.

GEM is not a complete operating system, but rather a graphical interface that runs on top of DOS.

The interface used in GEM was so similar to the Macintosh that Apple successfully sued for copyright infringement[1]. As a result of this lawsuit, DRI removed visual effects and overlapping windows from subsequent releases.
