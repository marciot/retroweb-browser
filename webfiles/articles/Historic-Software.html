== The first electronic psychotherapist ==

'''Between 1964 and 1966:''' While at MIT, Joseph Weizenbaum wrote Eliza, one of the earliest programs that tried to interact with humans in plain English. Eliza's DOCTOR script simulated a virtual psychotherapist. Although Eliza had no actual intelligence, her simple responses were surprisingly convincing to some people.[1]

Weizembaum's Eliza has been widely imitated and is the ancestor of modern chatbots.

'''March 1, 1974:''' Jim Bowery releases [[Spasim]], a 3D space simulator with a first person perspective.
