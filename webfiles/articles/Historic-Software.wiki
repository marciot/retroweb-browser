== The first electronic psychotherapist ==

'''Between 1964 and 1966:''' While at MIT, Joseph Weizenbaum wrote Eliza, one of the earliest programs that tried to interact with humans in plain English. Eliza's DOCTOR script simulated a virtual psychotherapist. Although Eliza had no actual intelligence, her simple responses were surprisingly convincing to some people.[1]

Weizembaum's Eliza has been widely imitated and is the ancestor of modern chatbots.

* Try a modern descendant of the [[Eliza program|RC759-Piccoline]] on the Danish RC759 Piccoline.
