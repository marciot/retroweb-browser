== Douglas Engelbart demonstrates the NLS ==

[[figure-float-right:/artwork/1968-Demo.jpg Frame from the 1968 demo, showing the chord pad, the keyboard and the mouse.]]

'''December 9th, 1968:''' Douglas Engelbart demonstrates the NLS, the first computer interface to incorporate hyperlinks, a mouse and a raster-scan video display for interacting with the computer[1]

* Watch the complete [http://www.1968demo.org 1968 Demo]
* Watch [http://www.invisiblerevolution.net/ The Invisible Resolution], a documentary about the life of Douglas Engelbart

== Xerox introduces the Xerox Alto ==

'''March 1st, 1973:''' The Xerox Alto computer, developed at the Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center), refined the concept of a graphical user interface and introduced the metaphor of the computer desktop[2].

It was also the first computer meant to be used by an individual person, what we today call the personal computer.

Although Xerox did not immediately commercialise the ideas embodied in the Alto, they did demonstrate it to Apple Computers, who later incorporated many of these ideas into the Macintosh.

A commercial successor to the Xerox Alto, the [[Xerox Star]], was released in 1981 but did not gain widespread use outside of a few businesses.

== VisiCorp demonstrates Visi On ==

'''Fall, 1982:''' VisiCorp demonstrates the [[Visi-On]] GUI for the IBM PC at COMDEX.

Although technically impressive and far ahead of it's time, it required a top-of-the-line IBM PC and a hard disk, a very expensive luxury at the time.

* Run Visi On [[inside your web browser|Visi-On.html]]!


== Apple introduces the Macintosh ==

[[Image-float-left:/artwork/apple-logo.png]]

'''January 24, 1984:''' Steve Jobs introduces the Macintosh 128k. While the mouse-based interface was inspired by the Xerox Alto, it was released to the home market at a price point that was far more affordable to individuals[5].

* Watch Steve Jobs [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2B-XwPjn9YY introduce the Macintosh]
* Experience the Macintosh through [[in-browser emulation|Apple-Macintosh.html]]!

== Digital Research demonstrates the GEM ==

'''November 1984:''' Digital Research, Inc. demonstrates GEM desktop for the IBM PC at COMDEX.

This graphical shell for DOS was such a close copy of the Macintosh that Apple successfully sued DRI for copyright infringement.

* Try [[GEM/1|GEM-Desktop.html]] for the IBM PC.

== Atari releases the Atari 520ST ==

[[figure-float-right:/artwork/gem.png The GEM GUI used on the Atari closely mimics the Macintosh]]

'''January 1985:''' Atari releases the Atari 520ST, with a graphical interface is a port of Digital Research's [[GEM Desktop]].

* Try out the Atari version of the GEM GUI in your [[web browser|Atari-1040ST.html]]!

== Commodore introduces the Amiga 1000 and AmigaOS ==

[[figure-float-left:/artwork/amiga-os.png A screenshot of the boing demo and the Workbench running simultaneously]]

'''July 23, 1985:''' Commodore releases the Amiga 1000, featuring a fully multitasking, multimedia-capable operating system.

* Take [[AmigaOS]] for a test drive!

== Microsoft ships Windows ==

[[figure-float-right:/artwork/windows-1.0-about.jpg About box from Windows 1.0]]

'''November 20, 1985:''' Microsoft ships the first version of Windows as an add on to Microsoft DOS[6].

* Take [[Windows 1.0]] for a test drive!
