# The PC does not recognize dates in this century, so try typing "1-1-80" (use the minus key in your keypad if the regular minus key does not work).
# There are several BASIC programs to try out on the PC-DOS disk. Do a "BASICA SAMPLE" to launch the menu. To return to DOS after a program runs, type SYSTEM.
