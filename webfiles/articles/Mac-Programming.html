= The Code Kid =

My parents took this picture of me in 1987. This was taken a few months after my parents took me back to Brazil, with our brand new Macintosh Plus in tow.

[[figure-screenshot:/artwork/Marcio1987_2.jpg Me, in 1987]]

Although the photo is not clear enough for me to see what program I was working on, the layout of windows is unmistakably Macintosh Pascal!

== Try it for yourself: ==

{
	"icons" : [
		["Programming Tools",  "boot-floppy", "/disks/mac-programming.image"],
		["Marcio's Apps",      "floppy",      "/disks/mac-marcio's-apps-1.0.image", {"drive" : "fd2"}]
	]
}

Try writing your own programs for the Macintosh using Basic or Pascal; or expore some of the programs I wrote as a kid!
