= The Code Kid =

My parents took this picture of me in 1987. This was taken a few months after my parents took me back to Brazil, with our brand new Macintosh Plus in tow.

[[figure-screenshot:/artwork/Marcio1987_2.jpg Me, in 1987]]

Although the photo is not clear enough for me to see what program I was working on, the layout of windows is unmistakably Macintosh Pascal, which you can experience for yourself with the floppy disk I provided&mdash;it contains the very copy of Macintosh Pascal that I used as a kid (and Basic too)!

== Try it for yourself: ==

	"icons" : [
		["Programming Tools",  "boot-floppy", "/disks/mac-programming.image"]
	]
