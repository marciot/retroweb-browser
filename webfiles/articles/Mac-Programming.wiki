= The Code Kid =

My parents took this picture of me in 1987. This was taken a few months after my parents took me back to Brazil, with our brand new Macintosh Plus in tow.

Although the photo is not clear enough for me to see what program I was working on, the layout of windows is unmistakably Macintosh Pascal, which you can experience for yourself with the floppy disk I provided&mdash;it contains the very copy of Macintosh Pascal that I used as a kid (and Basic too)!
