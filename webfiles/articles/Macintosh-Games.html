== 1984: Through the Looking Glass ==

[[image-float-left:/artwork/alice.png]]

In this fast-paced action game, Alice finds herself on a life-sized chess board where she must keep moving to avoid capture.

<cite>Through the Looking Glass</cite> was developed by Steve Capps while he was a member of the Lisa development team at Apple; the game made such an impression on Steve Jobs that he was recruited to the Macintosh team. Released in 1984, it has the distinction of being the first game sold for the Macintosh and the only game that Apple has ever published.

		["Through the Looking Glass",   "boot-floppy",       "/disks/mac-through-the-looking-glass.dsk", {"emulator-args" : {"-s" : "1"} }],
		["History of the Game", "hyperlink", "http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&story=Alice.txt"]
	],
	"class" : "float-center"
}

== 1986: Maze Wars+ ==

[[figure-float-right:/artwork/mazewars-eye.png MazeWars+ on the Macintosh]]

Maze War was an early multi-player game with a history dating back to 1974. This game lets you hunt down your opponent in a three-dimensional maze.

{ "icons" : [
		["Play MazeWars Online", "folder", "Maze-War.html", {"className": "world"}]
	],
	"class" : ""
}

Through technology developed exclusively for the <cite>RetroWeb Vintage Computer Museum</cite>, you can play MazeWars+ with others via the Internet!

== 1987: Inigo Goes Out ==

[[image-float-left:/artwork/inigo.png]]

Amanda Goodenough's <cite>Indigo Goes Out</cite> is an early example of the use of HyperCard for interactive storytelling. 

Released in 1987, the Inigo series foreshadow the popularity of click-and-point adventure games such as <cite>Cosmic Osmo</cite> and <cite>Myst</cite>.

{ "icons" : [		
		["Boot Disk",       "boot-hd",    "/disks/mac-boot-hypercard.qed"],
		["Inigo Stories",   "floppy",     "/disks/mac-inigo.dsk"]
	],
	"class": "center"
}

== 1988: The Colony ==

[[image-float-right:/artwork/the-colony.svg]]

{ "icons" : [
		["The Colony",   "boot-floppy",        "/disks/mac-colony.dsk",     {"emulator-args" : {"-c" : "pce-dual-hd.cfg"} }]
	],
	"class" : "float-left"
}

<cite>The Colony</cite> by David Alan Smith, was the first game to use real-time rendering. It allowed the player to roam freely through a 3D environment, unlike earlier games which restricted movement to pre-computed views.

It was released for the Macintosh and MS-DOS in 1988, and for the Amiga in 1990. The game was groundbreaking for the time and still looks good today.

== Games Collection ==

	"icons" : [
		["Games Collection",  "boot-floppy", "/disks/mac-games-1.image",       {"emulator-args" : {"-c" : "pce-dual-hd.cfg"} }],
		["Lemmings Demo",     "boot-floppy", "/disks/mac-lemmings-demo.image", {"emulator-args" : {"-c" : "pce-dual-hd.cfg"} }]
