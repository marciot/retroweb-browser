This is the Guided Tour from the 128K Macintosh. The audio cassette provided narration while the user performed exercises and watched demonstrations on their Mac's screen.

Thanks to Mac128DOTcom's excellent YouTube collection, you can experience what it was like to use the Guided Tour cassette. Listen to these videos while you follow along in the emulated Macintosh; or, simply sit back and watch the videos as they take you through the entire tour!

== A Very Early Version of the Finder ==

If you click "Let Me Use My Macintosh" during the guided tour, you can explore version 1.0 of the Finder.

Noticed the rudimentary mountain scene in the "About the Finder" box, the rough looking System icons and left facing ridges on the Trash can, which were modified in subsequent releases[1]. The about box credits Bruce Horn and Steve Capps as developers and show a date of December 4, 1983.

=== Steve Capps' AMAZING program ===

It is also noteworthy that the Guided Tour diskette contains the AMAZING program by Steve Capps, which was later bundled with the release of his game [[Through the Looking Glass]].
