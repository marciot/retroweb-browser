This is the Guided Tour from the 128K Macintosh. The audio cassette provided narration while the user performed exercises and watched demonstrations on their Mac's screen.

Thanks to Mac128DOTcom's excellent YouTube collection, you can experience what it was like to use the Guided Tour cassette. Listen to these videos while you follow along in the emulated Macintosh; or, simply sit back and watch the videos as they take you through the entire tour!

== Details to notice ==

If you click "Let Me Use My Macintosh" from this disk, you can explore a very early version of the Finder. Notice the extremely rudimentary mountain scene in "About the Finder", the rough looking System icons and the peculiar left facing ridges on the Trash can[1]. Many of these details were changed in subsequent releases.
