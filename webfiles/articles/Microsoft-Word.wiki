== Microsoft Word Demonstration ==

[[figure-float-right:/artwork/microsoft-word.jpg Microsoft Word 1.0 was the first Microsoft program to make extensive use of the mouse]]

This is a demonstration of the Microsoft Word demo disk that was bundled with the November 1983 issue of PC World magazine.

The boot disk contains IBM Personal Computer DOS Version 2.0 from 1983 (from the [http://www.hampa.ch/pce/download.html PCE downloads page]).

For mouse support, I have added the Microsoft Serial Mouse Driver 6.02. This was released in 1987, making it an anachronism&mdash;the mouse bundled with Microsoft Word in 1983 would have used an earlier version of the driver.

=== To run the demonstration disk: ===

The following demonstration disk comes from Nathan's GUI gallery; be sure to check out his page for a comprehensive [http://toastytech.com/guis/word115.html walk-through] of this software.

# Click the "DOS 2.0 Boot Disk" icon
# Wait for the computer to boot
# Click the "Word 1.0 Demo Disk" icon
# Click on the computer screen
# At the "C:\>" prompt, type "a:", then ENTER
# Then type "word" followed by ENTER
