In the days before broadband, computers used dial-up modems to communicate with one another. Some early games made use of this technology to allow people to play games together.

}

Through technology developed exclusively for the <cite>RetroWeb Vintage Computer Museum</cite>, you can play MazeWars+ with others via the Internet!
