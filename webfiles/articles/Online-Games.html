= Multi-Player Online Games =

In the days before broadband, computers used dial-up modems to communicate with one another. Some early games made use of this technology to allow people to play games together.

This web page emulates a computer with a modem, allowing you to play games with other people who visit this web page! You and your opponent will need a virtual telephone number to connect to one another.

== MazeWars+ ==

This game lets you hunt down your opponent in a three-dimensional maze. MazeWars+ was released in 1986 and is very capable for the time.  You can pick custom avatars, select from multiple robotic side-kicks and communicate with your opponent via text messages.

To connect to another player:

{ "icons" : [
		["MazeWars+",  "boot-floppy",  "/disks/mac-mazewars-plus-1.1.dsk"]
	]
}

* Get a virtual phone number above and then click the MazeWars+ floppy.
* Enter your name, and select your avatar.
* Click the Phone icon, or select "Phone..." from the "Options" menu.
* Instruct a friend to visit this page on their own computer and do the same.
* You check the "Auto Answer" checkbox and click "OK"
* Your friend type in your virtual phone number and clicks "Dial"
* Select "About MazeWars+..." from the Apple menu to learn the keyboard controls.

== ZTerm ==

{ "icons" : [
		["Boot Disk", "boot-hd",      "/disks/mac-marcio's-boot-1.0.qed"],
		["ZTerm",     "floppy",       "/disks/mac-zterm-0.9.img"]
	]
}

Or, use ZTerm to interact with the modem, chat with one another, or transfer files the primitive way!
