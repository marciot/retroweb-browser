= Forethought PowerPoint =

In April of 1987, a startup called Forethought released a presentation program for the Macintosh called &ldquo;PowerPoint&rdquo;[1]. Three months later, this product was acquired by Microsoft. Interestingly, it took two full years before Microsoft released a version of PowerPoint for their own operating system!
