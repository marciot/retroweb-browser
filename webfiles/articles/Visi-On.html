= VisiCorp Visi On =

As a follow-up to their successful VisiCalc product, VisiCorp began development of a GUI for the [[IBM PC]]. This product, called Visi On, was demonstrated at COMDEX in 1982 and predated the [[Macintosh]] and [[Microsoft Windows]].

== To Run the Demonstration: ==

{
	"icons" : [
		["Visi On Boot Disk",          "boot-hd",   "/disks/ibmpc-vision.pimg",
			{"emulator-args" : {"-c" : "pce-config-5160-early-msys-mouse.cfg"} } ],
		["Visi On Apps 1",             "floppy",    "/disks/ibmpc-vision-app1.psi"],
		["Nathan's Visi On Page",      "hyperlink", "http://toastytech.com/guis/vision.html"]
	]
}

# Click the "VisiOn Boot Disk"
# Click the "Visi On Apps 1" disk<br>(do this as the computer is booting)
# When prompted, calibrate the mouse by clicking on the center of the PC's screen and by moving the mouse around for a second or two.
# Check out Nathan's page for a walk-through of the GUI.

These demonstration disks were provided by Nathan Lineback. Be sure to check out his excellent [http://toastytech.com/guis/index.html GUI Gallery] page for more great information on early PC GUIs.

The IBM PC emulator is a JavaScript port of Hampa Hug's PCE (PC Emulator)[1].
The Javascript port is based on work done by James Friend[2]
