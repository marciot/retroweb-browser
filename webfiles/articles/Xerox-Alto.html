= Xerox Alto =

The [[Xerox Alto]] computer was developed at the Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) and released in March 1, 1973. The Alto was the first computer to make user of a graphical user interface, including a mouse to interact with on-screen buttons and icons.

Although Xerox did not immediately commercialise the ideas embodied in the Alto, they did demonstrate it to a team from Apple Computers, who later incorporated many of the ideas into the graphical interface of the Apple Lisa and the Macintosh.

== Taking the Alto for a test drive ==

This page provides a working demo of the Xerox Alto using the SALTO [[emulator]] by Juergen Buchmueller. There is a good walk-through of the SALTO emulator on [[toastytech.com]]

<div class="hints">
# The emulation on this page is currently slow and buggy. At this stage it is a work-in-progress.
# The text on the Alto's screen is too small to read; hover the mouse cursor on the screen and click the magnifying glass to expand.
# The keyboard will often fail to register keys; to type, hold down each key down until it appears.
</div>

== The Alto Executive ==

{
	"icons" : [
		["Boot Disk",       "boot-hd", "/disks/alto-games.dsk"]
	]
}

Upon boot, you will be presented with the text-based Alto Executive. A mouse cursor is visible at all times, but appears to serve no function at this point.

At the prompt, type "?" to list the files on disk; files with the ".RUN" extension are executables. You can start a program by typing the first few distinguishing letters of their names&mdash;for example, typing "nep" followed by ENTER is sufficient start the NEPTUNE file manager.

Although the Xerox Alto is noted for being the first computer to make use of a graphical user interface, these features were limited to the few programs that chose to use them.

== The NEPTUNE File Manager ==

The NEPTUNE file is an example of a mouse-based program. It allows the user to rename, delete or copy files. The interface resembles a modern dialog box, with two file lists, rudimentary scroll bars and buttons for initiating actions. The mouse cursor is context sensitive, changing shapes on different parts of the screen.

== Notable Games and Demos ==

Several games can be started from the Alto Executive prompt (you need only type the __underlined__ letters):

; __pi__nball
: A very impressive graphical pinball game
; __poo__l
: A billards simulator
; __ma__ze
: A maze game, very similar to the one later shipped with the [[Apple Macintosh]].
; __mi__ssile
: Protect the cities from incoming missiles
; __sp__acewar
: A StarTrek simulator
; __f__ly
: Appears to be a fly-swatting game
; __ba__ttleship
: A networked battleship game; not playable since there is no network

There are also a few graphics demos:

; __pol__ygons
: A polygon painting demonstration
; __k__inetic4
: Makes Mondrian style art

== Maze War: The First Multi-Player First Person Shooter ==

[[figure-float-right:/artwork/alto-mazewar.jpg Maze Wars on the Alto, [http://www.digibarn.com/collections/games/xerox-maze-war/ www.digibarn.com] ]]

In 1973, Steve Colley developed one of the most well-know game for the Xerox Alto: <cite>Maze War</cite>. 

The first version of Maze War only allowed the player to explore a 3D maze alone, but it was later enhanced to allow other players to join the game. Players were rendered as eyeballs and the game allowed players to shoot each other. Thus, <cite>Maze War</cite> was the very first multi-player first person shooter game.

Several articles have been written about this ground-breaking game and its place in history:

* [[The Maze War 30 Year Retrospective]] at the DigiBarn
* [[The First First-Person Shooter]] by Richard Moss

Although I have not yet located a copy of <cite>Maze War</cite> that could be played in the emulator,  you can get a taste of what playing Maze War might have been like by playing <cite>MazeWars+</cite>, a 1986 remake for the [[Apple Macintosh]] that allows up to sixteen players to play simultaneously:

{ "icons" : [
		["Play MazeWars+ Online", "folder", "Maze-War.html", {"className": "world"}]
	],
	"class" : ""
}

== Inside the Xerox Alto ==

For a comprehesive look inside the Alto, I highly recommend Ken Shirriff's multi-part series on the Alto. The series documents restoring a Xerox Alto to operating condition, includes tons of photos, software walk-throughs and technical details on how the Alto hardware and software operated.
