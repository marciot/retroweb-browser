== Where are the demo disks? ==

Sadly, I don't have an emulator for this computer, so there are no demo disks.

Programmers, consider this to be a call to action, an emulation X Prize of sorts. Your prize for submitting a working JavaScript Xerox Star emulator: eternal fame, fortune and your name right here on this web page&mdash;I can only guarantee one of these things :)
