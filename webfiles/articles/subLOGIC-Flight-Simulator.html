= subLOGIC Flight Simulator =

Starting in 1976, Bruce Artwick's drew up plans for a flight simulator program for the personal computer. Following its release as the subLOGIC Flight Simulator, this program pushed the graphics capabilities of early personal computers to the limit.

The subLOGIC Flight Simulator was later licensed to Microsoft for sales on the IBM PC and the Macintosh and is the ancestor of the current flight simulator products from Microsoft.

== Flight Controls ==

The first Apple II demo disk contains an excellent flight manual. You should read it. But I have also included the key controls here as a quick reference:

|!  Key           |!   Function           |
|^ F, H           | Rudder left/right     |
|^ G              | Center rudder         |
|^ T, V/B         | Elevators up/down     |
|^ &larr;, &rarr; | Throttle control      |
|^ . (period)     | Break (when grounded) |
|^ 1 and 2        | Toggle view (FS 2+)   |
