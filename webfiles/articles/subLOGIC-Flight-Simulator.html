= subLOGIC Flight Simulator =

Starting in 1976, Bruce Artwick's drew up plans for a flight simulator program for the personal computer. Following its release as the subLOGIC Flight Simulator, this program pushed the graphics capabilities of early personal computers to the limit.

The subLOGIC Flight Simulator was later licensed to Microsoft for sales on the IBM PC and the Macintosh and is the ancestor of the current flight simulator products from Microsoft.

To run subLOGIC Flight Simulator on the Commodore 64:

* Click the "C64 Flight Sim 2" disk
* At the "READY" prompt, type "run" (all lowercase).
* Type ENTER

<div class="set-class-hints">
# Type '''slowly''' and '''delibrately''', waiting for each character to appear before going to the next. The emulator may occasionally miss keys, so you may need to press a key again.
</div>

{
	"icons" : [
		["TRS-80 Flight Sim 1",          "boot-floppy", "/disks/trs80-fs1.dsk"]
	]
}

A rea; TRS-80 has a physical switch to enable the use of floppy disks. Since we are running an emulator, we have to use a special sequence of keystrokes in order to access this switch. Please follow these directions:

* Click the "TRS-80 Flight Sim 1" disk
* Wait for the "MEMORY SIZE?" prompt
* Click on the computer's screen
* Hit ESC to bring up the emulator menu
* Press TAB to bring up another menu
* Hit the down arrow twice to select "Driver Configuration"
* Press the right arrow to turn on Floppy Disk Drives
* Press TAB
* Press F3 to restart the computer (you will see a DOS screen shortly)
* Press ESC

You will be able to start the simulator. The controls do not seem to operate.

== Flight Controls ==

The first Apple II demo disk contains an excellent flight manual. You should read it. But I have also included the key controls here as a quick reference:

|!  Key           |!   Function           |
|^ F, H           | Rudder left/right     |
|^ G              | Center rudder         |
|^ T, V/B         | Elevators up/down     |
|^ &larr;, &rarr; | Throttle control      |
|^ . (period)     | Break (when grounded) |
|^ 1 and 2        | Toggle view (FS 2+)   |
