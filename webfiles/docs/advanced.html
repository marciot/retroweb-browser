= Advanced Actions =

The advanced actions allow you to access special emulator features. These actions are intended for more technically savvy users.

== Upload and Download Floppy ==

{
	"icons" : [
		["Upload Floppy",   "upload-floppy"],
		["Download Floppy", "download-floppy"]
	]
}

The "Upload Floppy" action can be used to load floppy images that are stored on local computer into the emulator.

The "Download Floppy" action can be to save back the modified disk image. Generally this will only work if the emulator has saved changes back to the disk image.

Not all disk images will be compatible with this emulator and vintage software is often distributed in files that must be unpacked and copied into disk images using other tools.

== What is the RetroWeb? ==

The RetroWeb is the name I coined for a hyper-linked collection of content for use with an emulated computer. The RetroWeb Virtual Computer Museum is an emulator running alongside an interface that allows you to navigate that content.

Although computer emulators already exist in various forms and there are many web sites devoted to the preservation of historical software, I believe this web app represents the first time that articles about historical computers and software have been put right next to the means to interact with it.
