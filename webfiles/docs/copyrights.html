			<h2>Copyrights and Fair Use</h2>
			<p>
				This web page by necessity includes computer boot code which is copyrighted by
				Apple Inc. and others. I have researched copyright law and my conclusion is that
				this work, in its present form, constitutes fair use under the U.S. copyright law.
			</p>
			<p> This work is entirely non-profit: it is intended primarily to showcase software
				that I have written and to educate others on the early Macintosh; I have included
				only as much copyrighted material as necessary to present my work; and none of this
				diminishes the market value of Apple's current products (it has been over
				twenty years since Apple sold a Mac like this one).
			</p>
				I own a few Mac Plus computers in working condition (including the original
				purchased by my family in 1986) and have licenses for all the software
				used. Since this website neither allows a user to do useful work (all documents
				are lost when the user leaves the page), nor encourages the downloading of the
				software for later use, I see this website as the virtual equivalent of inviting
				someone into my home for a demonstration of my old Macs.
