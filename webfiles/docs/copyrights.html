= Copyrights and Fair Use =

This web page makes use of computer code, images and software which are copyrighted by their respective owners. It is the maintainer's belief that this work, in its present form, may constitute ''fair use'' under the U.S. Copyright Law[1].

* This work is entirely non-profit and non-commercial.
* This work is educational: the purpose of this website is to teach people personal computer history by allowing them to compare and contrast historic personal computers while interacting with computer software from the era.
* I have included only as much copyrighted material as is necessary to meet these goals (i.e. allowing the computers to fully boot so that users can interact with them).
* I believe nothing presented here diminishes the market value of any product which is presently being sold: even in cases where a descendant of a product still exists, I have restricted my selections to early and obsolete versions.
* I believe the use is transformative[2][3][4]: these computers, in their original purpose, allowed the user to do productive work; here, they are presented as historical artefacts that are not practical for that use (due to limitations on the ability to save work or print documents, for example).

'''Disclaimer: I am not a lawyer and I do not have a legal background. These are my own interpretations. Those wishing to do something similar or expanding upon my ideas should not take the above as legal advice.'''
