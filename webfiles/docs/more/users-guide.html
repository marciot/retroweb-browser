			<p>
				The code I have written is provided for free and is licensed under the GPL. You may
				obtain the source code at the <a href="https://github.com/marciot/retroweb-browser" target="_new">
				Retroweb-Browser on Git Hub</a>. The source code distribution includes what you need

			<a id="source"><h2>Basic Actions</h2></a>
			<p>
				The actions allow you to interact with the navigator
				and the simulated computer.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Restart Computer</h3>
			<p>
				This action restarts the emulated computer. It is
				useful if the computer has crashed. Refreshing the
				webpage also restarts the computer, but you will
				have to wait for the disk images to download from
				the server again and changes to the local disks
				will be lost. The Restart action is much faster
				and will preserve your changes.
			</p>
			<h3>Go Back</h3>
			<p>
				This action takes you back to your previous location
				in the navigator.
			</p>
			<h3>Go Home</h3>
			<p>
				This action takes you back to the starting location
				in the navigator.
			</p>
			
			<a id="source"><h2>Advanced Actions</h2></a>
			<p>
				The advanced actions allow you to access special
				emulator features. These actions are intended
				for more technically savvy users.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Load ROM</h3>
			<p>
				This action allows you to load in a ROM image for
				use by the emulator. This is required to start
				the emulated computer. This emulator supports the
				ROM images that are distributed in the PCE download
				page.
			</p>
			<h3>Local floppy</h3>
			<p>
				This action can be used to load floppy images that
				are stored on local computer into the emulator.
			</p>
			<p>
				Not all disk images will be compatible with this
				emulator and vintage software is often distributed
				in files that must be unpacked and copied into disk
				images using other tools.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you wish to obtaining software on your own, the
				following websites will get you started:
