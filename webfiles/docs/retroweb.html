			<h2>What is the RetroWeb?</h2>
			<p>
				The RetroWeb is the name I coined for a hyper-linked collection
				of content for use with an emulated computer. A RetroWeb browser,
				by extension, is an emulator running alongside an interface
				that allows you to navigate that content. This webapp, which
				curiously runs inside your web browser, is thus a RetroWeb browser.
				It allows you to surf a specially curated portion of the web
				related to this emulated computer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although computer emulators already exist in various forms and there are
				many web sites devoted to the preservation of historical software, I
				believe this webapp represents the first time that the means to find
				software and documentation has been put right next to the means to interact
				with it.
			</p>
			<h3>Using RetroWeb URL</h3>
			</p>
				The "Enter RetroWeb URL" icon allows you to enter an URL for a RetroWeb
				JSON index file. These are similar to web URLs, but must point to a
				specially formatteed JSON file. This feature will not be very useful
				until others begin to host content for this webapp.
			</p>
			<p>
				This webapp makes use of <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> and
				<a href="http://enable-cors.org/">CORS</a> technologies to allow for the
				dynamic hyper-linking of resources, thus providing the "web" part of
				RetroWeb.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you own a website, you can use this functionality to host
				your own resources for this emulator. By publishing an index file
				and implementing CORS, others will be allowed to link from their
				content to yours.
