			<a id="source"><h2>Source Code and Redistribution</h2></a>
			<p>
				The code I have written is provided for free and is licensed under the GPL. You may
				obtain the source code at the <a href="https://github.com/marciot/retroweb-browser" target="_new">
				Retroweb-Browser on Git Hub</a>. The source code distribution includes what you need
				to host this webapp on your own website.
			</p>
					
			<a id="source"><h2>Basic Actions</h2></a>
			<p>
				The actions allow you to interact with the navigator
				and the simulated computer.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Go Back</h3>
			<p>
				This action takes you back to your previous location
				in the navigator.
			</p>
			<h3>Go Home</h3>
			<p>
				This action takes you back to the starting location
				in the navigator.
			</p>
			<h3>Restart Computer</h3>
			<p>
				This action restarts the emulated computer. It is
				useful if the computer has crashed. Refreshing the
				webpage also restarts the computer, but you will
				have to wait for the disk images to download from
				the server again and changes to the local disks
				will be lost. The Restart action is much faster
				and will preserve your changes.
			</p>
			
			<a id="source"><h2>Advanced Actions</h2></a>
			<p>
				The advanced actions allow you to access special
				emulator features. These actions are intended
				for more technically savvy users.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Load ROM</h3>
			<p>
				This action allows you to load in a ROM image for
				use by the emulator. This is required to start
				the emulated computer. This emulator supports the
				ROM images that are distributed in the PCE download
				page.
			</p>
			<h3>Local floppy</h3>
			<p>
				This action can be used to load floppy images that
				are stored on local computer into the emulator.
			</p>
			<p>
				Not all disk images will be compatible with this
				emulator and vintage software is often distributed
				in files that must be unpacked and copied into disk
				images using other tools.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Enter RetroWeb URL</h3>
			</p>
				The "Enter RetroWeb URL" icon allows you to enter an URL for a RetroWeb
				JSON index file. These are similar to web URLs, but must point to a
				specially formatteed JSON file. This feature will not be very useful
				until others begin to host content for this webapp.
			</p>

			<a id="retroweb"><h2>What is the RetroWeb?</h2></a>
			<p>
				The RetroWeb is the name I coined for a hyper-linked collection
				of content for use with an emulated computer. A RetroWeb browser,
				by extension, is an emulator running alongside an interface
				that allows you to navigate that content. This webapp, which
				curiously runs inside your web browser, is thus a RetroWeb browser.
				It allows you to surf a specially curated portion of the web
				related to this emulated computer.
			</p>
			<p>
				Although computer emulators already exist in various forms and there are
				many web sites devoted to the preservation of historical software, I
				believe this webapp represents the first time that the means to find
				software and documentation has been put right next to the means to interact
				with it.
			</p>
			
			<a id="retroweb-hosting"><h2>Hosting RetroWeb Content</h2></a>
			<p>
				This webapp makes use of <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a> and
				<a href="http://enable-cors.org/">CORS</a> technologies to allow for the
				dynamic hyper-linking of resources, thus providing the "web" part of
				RetroWeb.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you own a website, you can use this functionality to host
				your own resources for this emulator. By publishing an index file
				and implementing CORS, others will be allowed to link from their
				content to yours.
			</p>
