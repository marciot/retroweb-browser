== Source Code and Redistribution ==

The code I have written is provided for free and is licensed under the GPL. You may obtain the source code at the [[Retroweb Browser on Git Hub]]. The source code distribution includes what you need to host this webapp on your own website.

== Basic Actions ==

These actions allow you to interact with the navigator and the simulated computer.

=== Go Back ===

This action takes you back to your previous location in the navigator.

=== Go Home ===

This action takes you back to the starting location in the navigator.

=== Restart Computer ===

This action restarts the emulated computer. It is useful if the computer has crashed. Refreshing the webpage also restarts the computer, but you will have to wait for the disk images to download from the server again and changes to the local disks will be lost. The Restart action is much faster and will preserve your changes.

== Advanced Actions ==

The advanced actions allow you to access special emulator features. These actions are intended for more technically savvy users.
